# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview
The goal of this project is to summarize the ride sharing data by city type and to also show (using a multi-line graph) the total weekly fares for each city type.
# Results
## Urban, Suburban, Rural City Comparison
- Rides given in Urban cities gave the overwhelming majority of rides. As such, they have more drivers than both Rural and Suburban Cities combined. Additionally, the average fare per ride in Urban cities is $10 cheaper than rides given in Rural cities and the average fare per driver is more than 3x less than the average fare per driver in Rural cities. The most noticeable point was that the Urban total fare came out to nearly 9x the fares accumulated in Rural cities!

## Weekly Fare Analysis 
- everyone saw spike during last week of february
- All fares remain relatively consistent throughout the weeks
- Near the last week of April there is a spike in suburban rides. This could be due to the fact that a lot of schools have Spring Break around that time and more people (who live in suburban communities) could be going home for the week.

# Summary
Based on the results above, my business recommendations would to be as follow: Add more rural drivers. As of now, the rural drivers are taking longer trips because there are less of them to spare. Less drivers means more are occupied and they can't meet the demand that would happen if there were more drivers to choose from.
